            <h2>About us</h2>
            <h3>From the Desk of the Academic Head</h3>
            <p><strong>Mrs. Kavitha Sudakar, M.Sc., M.Phil., DMTP</strong></p>
            <p>Greetings from me and Team Divyataa.</p>
            <p>We share a dream, with the millions of parents, that our children get the best of everything, that our children would blossom to their fullest potentials and reach for the skies yet remain grounded drawing strength from their roots.</p>
            <p>We know that a healthy child is a physically, cognitively, socially and emotionally healthy child.</p>
            <p>We realise that a child’s brain is most impressionable from birth through 7 years of age are incessantly downloading information from their environment through their senses which forms sort of a blueprint for behaviour and personality throughout their life.</p>
            <p>We are aware that the immediate environment of the child at that age and people in it who are the family and school hold an enormous responsibility towards building the child’s personality.</p>
            <p>We are committed to providing a healthy environment conducive for their growth on all fronts, and to educating the whole child.</p>
            <p>We believe in the joint effort of parents and facilitators at school in nurturing the multiple intelligences of the child and to this effect empowering parents with pertinent tools to bring forth harmony in approach.</p>
            <p>We have put together the best of curriculums which is the globally acclaimed, proven and time-tested Montessori methodology at the crux of our education along with other proven practices including mindfulness activities, self-regulation exercises, emotional intelligence, public speaking skills, culture education and many more to nurture and sculpt the various facets that will give the child a wholesome proactive personality.</p>
            <p>We invite you Parents to join hands with us on this endeavor and let us together build a resilient, gritty, rock-solid pedestal for our children, which will empower them for life with a skillset that would enable them to soar and conquer.</p>
            <p>We welcome you on a journey that would make the most significant contribution in creating a wholesome positive personality for your child.</p>
